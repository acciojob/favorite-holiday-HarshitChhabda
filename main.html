				<h1>Goa</h1>
				<br>
	<p>Goa is India’s smallest state by its geographical area and the fourth smallest by population. The state has been a very important historical and cultural centre since ancient times. In a Hindu scripture Mahabharata it is referred as Gopakpattan or Gomant and in Sutra- Samhita it was mentioned as Govapuri. Located on India’s West coast, Goa is a former Portuguese colony with prolific history. The state has unique blend of Indian and Portuguese culture, art and architecture that pulls approx 2.5 millions (wiki) tourists every year. And hence Goa is visibly different from the rest of India.</p>
